# emdy-calculator
This is a simple calculator application, which i coded by Kotlin. It is my first Kotlin project. So that why I only focus to learn how to understand and use Layouts/Views in XML layout, not pay much attention to logical calculating.

* Build layout by XML file
* Learn to use layouts/views: LinearLayout, GridLayout, TextView, View, Button
* Interact with button, rebuild UI when buttons were clicked
